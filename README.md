- What is Design Pattern?
  Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code


<h2 style="text-align:center;">The Catalog of Design Patterns</h2>

- Creational patterns:
    These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

- Structural patterns
    These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Behavioral patterns
    These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.


<h2 style="text-align:center;">Creational patterns</h2>

1- Factory pattern
    - is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

2- Abstract Factory
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

3- Singleton
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

4- Builder
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

5- Prototype
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Structural Patterns</h2>


<img src="./image/decorator.png" alt="Picture" width="800" height="600">

1- Decorator
    - is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

<img src="./image/proxy.png" alt="Picture" width="800" height="600">

2- Proxy
    -  is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

3- Adapter
    - is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

<img src="./image/composite.png" alt="Picture" width="800" height="600">

3- Composite
    - is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

<img src="./image/bridge.png" alt="Picture" width="800" height="600">

3- Bridge
    - is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
