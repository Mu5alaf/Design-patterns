- What is Design Pattern?
  Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code

## The Catalog of Design Patterns

- Creational patterns:
    These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

- Structural patterns
    These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Behavioral patterns
    These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Creational patterns

1- Factory pattern
    - is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

2- Abstract Factory
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

3- Singleton
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

4- Builder
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

5- Prototype
    - is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
